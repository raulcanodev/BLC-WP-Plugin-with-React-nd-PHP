# WordPress Blocks Plugin

This repository contains a WordPress plugin that adds three new blocks:

1. **Separator:** A block that creates a horizontal line to separate content.
2. **Linked Buttons:** A block that allows adding buttons with links to different pages or resources.
3. **Image Gallery:** A block that displays a gallery of images within the content.
